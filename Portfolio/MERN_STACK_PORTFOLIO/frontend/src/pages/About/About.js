                Iâ€™m an Open-Source enthusiast & a junior pursuing my Bachelors
                in Electronics and Telecommunication
                (currently in 1st year) but I am more
                passionate about Computer Science &
                Engineering. I am creatively curious
                and a self learner. I love exploring
                new technologies and currently learning
                new skills. I've worked on many small
                projects which helps me to expand my
                knowledge and learn some new skills.
